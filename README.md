# SMS Spam Classifier

A machine learning application for classifying SMS messages as spam or not spam using Streamlit for the user interface. The classifier is built with Scikit-learn and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses SMS text using stemming and stopword removal.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using a dataset of SMS messages.
- **Prediction**: Classifies new SMS messages as spam or not spam with probability estimates.
- **Streamlit App**: Provides an interactive web interface to input SMS messages and get predictions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip



## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The Streamlit application script.
- `train_model.py`: Script for training and saving the machine learning model.
- `spam.csv`: The dataset used for training the model (should be in the project directory).
- `sms_spam_classifier.pkl`: Saved model file (created after training).
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Model Performance

The model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, will be displayed in the console after training.




- The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).
- Streamlit documentation and community for making interactive web apps easy.
